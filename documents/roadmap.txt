This roadmap contains different sections that need to be completed, and sub-sections detailing 
potential goals for each 2-week period.

1. Initailization and study
    Set up GitHub repository, and make sure commits/pulls work as intended
    Create specifications, changelog, and roadmap
    Plan/implement empty website framework
    Connect database system to empty website framework, and make sure it works as intended

2. Bare-bones implementation and testing
    Add the ability to create/manage an account
    Add the ability to create/manage multiple databases from an account

3. Complete implementation and testing
    Create different database forms based on the user's selected sport
    Add the ability to manipulate data using any number of advanced analytics
    Add the ability to allow the user to create & use custom analytics
    Add the ability to export databases to Excel/Google Sheets

4. Aesthetic Components
    CSS/anything else visually related

Note that these sections and sub-sections aren't meant to be allotted specific amounts of time each.  Some will take 
much longer than others, as I have more experience with some areas(website framework, database linking) than other 
areas(anything CSS or visually related, as it pertains to HTML).
