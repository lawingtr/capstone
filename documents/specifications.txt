OSDH Project
Spring 2019
CS 4800
Thomas Lawing


The project, in its simplest form, is an online hosting platform for any number of sports databases.  The databases
are personalized to the sport that the user selects, and are easy to populate/manipulate.  Anyone should be able to
use this tool, including someone who has minimal experience with databases of any sort.

Ideally, the project will include a profile system that allows each user to personally manage their own databases 
at any time, from any location, so long as they have access to the website.  The intended use is personalized data 
tracking and manipulation for everyone, including fans, players, and coaches.  The tool is also intended to expose 
the uses of advanced data metrics(analytics) to the average sports fan/competitor, in hopes that they will recognize 
the uses of these metrics, and apply them to their own datasets.
