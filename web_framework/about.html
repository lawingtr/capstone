    <h2>What is EZ Sports?</h2>
    <p>EZ Sports is a free, easy-to-use tool designed to help coaches, players, and fans of all 
	sports, at all levels.  At its core, the tool focuses on hosting custom databases created 
	by users that allow for easy tracking of physical, sport-specific, and analytical statistics 
	across a wide range of sports.
    </p>
    <h2>Why use this tool?</h2>
    <p>The major goal of EZ Sports centers ease-of-access regardless of technical experience or 
	level of competition.  From the middle school basketball coach, to the high school football 
	player's parent, to the casual AA baseball fan, tracking stats and data shouldn't be something that 
	takes away from the game, but something that improves it.
    </p>
    <h2>Where do I begin?</h2>
    <p>Begin by creating an account using the "Register" button at the top-right of your page.  If you 
	already have an account, log in and use the "New" tab to either create a database using one of 
	our pre-existing templates, or create your own from scratch.</p>
